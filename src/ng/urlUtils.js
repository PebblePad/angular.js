 * Implementation Notes for non-IE browsers
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Assigning a URL to the href property of an anchor DOM node, even one attached to the DOM,
 * results both in the normalizing and parsing of the URL.  Normalizing means that a relative
 * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.
 * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related
 * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide
 * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+ etc.  See
 * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html
 *
 * Implementation Notes for IE
 * ---------------------------
 * IE <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other
 * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify
 * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = "foo", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We
 * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized
 * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the
 * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.
